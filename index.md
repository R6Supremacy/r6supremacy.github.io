# Rig-6 Supremacy
R6 stands as the timeless pinnacle, the supreme embodiment of nostalgia, the uniform of gods in the realm of Roblox, and we stand united in our sacred duty to safeguard its sanctity. As the days pass, Roblox drifts further into the clutches of corporate influence, its once vibrant community spirit fading into obscurity. Despite the collective resistance, the relentless imposition of Rthro persists, a bitter pill forced upon players who yearn for a different path. R15, a mere shadow of its predecessor, pales in comparison to the resplendent glory of R6. Yet, despite its shortcomings, we find ourselves reluctantly accommodating R15's presence, the last vestige of tolerable change. 

Rthro, a loathsome abomination, stands as a blight that must be eradicated from the sacred realm of ROBLOXia. Our duty is clear: to rise against this menace, alongside our battle against the creeping corporate grasp, the unbridled chaos of unmoderated UGCs, the superficiality of layered clothing, and the eerie intrusion of animated faces. United, we shall wield our defiance as a sword against these encroaching shadows That which threatens to tear apart the very fabric of our cherished world shall be met with unwavering resolve. In this relentless struggle, we forge our legacy, defenders of the pure essence that once defined ROBLOXia. With each step, we etch our mark in the annals of resistance, vowing to preserve the heart and soul of our realm against the tides of change.

- Don't worry however, we are not neo-facists, facists, nazis, neo-nazis, white/black supremacists, racists, or anything related to that. The term "Supremacy" means that we take seriously the hate on Rthro, and we are not joking when we say it must be brutally annihilated of the face of our illustrious ROBLOXia.
